                            My third learning goal for this semester was to improve my time management and project management skills. This goal is extremely important not only as a graduate student, but also because these skills are transferable to almost any other area of work. To complete my goal, I had meaningful conversations with my learning coach who has made the transition from academia to industry with over 15 years of experience. I also read books and took part in workshops and actively used what I have been learning with my supervisor.

                            One of the experiences that I participated in was completing a Linkedin Learning course on Project Management Foundations.  Intelligence Foundations. This course aligns very well with my learning goal of improving my time and project management skills. What stood out the most was the variety of management software available such as MS Project, Primavera, Smartsheet, and Asana among many others.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            I also read the book “Atomic Habits" by James Clear. This book is about breaking bad habits and reinforcing productive ones. This was recommended to me by my learning coach. As a graduate student, I think it would be beneficial to start building good habits now before the transition to industry. In grad school, the supervisor-student relationship is not unlike the boss-subordinate relationship. From this book, I read up on how to manage main projects, side projects, learning to let things go, and creating a priority chart. The last of which I actively use with my supervisor to show the incremental progress in my work.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Finally, I have had many conversations with my learning coach which adds another level towards time/project management because he is also the leader of my bible study group. I know firsthand that he manages a work, family, and spiritual commitments. My conversations with my learning coach are enlightening and the skills that he has demonstrated are what I aspire towards.

                When I registered for GPS 974 and 984, I did not know what to expect because they were mandatory for my fellowship. However, I quickly realized that these courses would be a good opportunity to develop skills like communication, adaptability, interpersonal skills, and collaboration. Especially because I expect to transition out of academia into industry, this course would be great for someone like me who has been in school my entire life. My education has spanned biology, biophysics, and now biomedical engineering. There are so many times when I feel like I've drifted so far from where I began, and it feels daunting to integrate what I've learned over the years into something cohesive. The GPS courses have proven to be an effective way of better understanding myself and better demonstrating how my skills in academia are transferable towards other areas.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                Through the GPS courses, I found my strongest strengths to be honesty, fairness, forgiveness, curiosity, and love of learning. What stood out to me immediately were curiosity and love of learning and how fitting it was. I was born on a university campus when my father was doing his PhD so it is not an exaggeration to say that I have been in school my entire life. From these strengths, I had to introspectively assess myself and create my mission statement.

            <p align="justify">
                Truthfully, I have never considered what my life mission would be before this course. I think I have had the privilege of being in a socio-economic position where I could carefreely pursue learning. I think I can more confidently state that my mission is to uphold honesty, accountability, community, support, and growth in areas of science education/communication. With my multidisciplinary background spanning biology, biophysics, and biomedical engineering, I can serve as a conduit to enhance collaboration among researchers and foster a nurturing environment for scientific discovery.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                To aid in my mission, I created three SMART goals towards improving my communication capabilities, more effectively expand my domain knowledge, and better manage my time and my projects. Some of my activities included giving presentations at the International Biofabrication Conference and the Canadian Light Source Annual Users’ Meeting. I read meaningful books like “Tomorrow’s Professor” to learn strategies for communicating concepts across education levels. I conversed regularly with my learning coach, who has made the academia-industry transition, and he recommended “Atomic Habits” for building good habits to be effective in any job. I found several Linkedin courses and attended several workshops directly related to my work, and for improving my soft skills.

                My learning coach was Thian-Peng Ter, Senior Product Development Manager at Workiva with over 15 years of professional experience. I deeply respect Thian-Peng's transition from academia to industry. He has shared this experience with me and helped illustrate how my skills and experiences in academia can translate to the workplace. Furthermore, he is my bible study group leader and I know first-hand, just how capable he is in balancing work, personal life, and spiritual commitments. In recent months, our discussions have centered on how to align my goals with my supervisors, building relationships, managing up, balancing life, building good habits, and valuing our church community. I often look forward to and enjoy our chats with plenty of things to learn from.

                In addition, there have been many other learning opportunities this term. I looked up the Learning Hub for effective ways to make condense information for resumes and how to tailor resumes for specific job criteria. My peers hosted potlucks for intercultural exchange which was very enjoyable. All the discussions with students across so many different disciplines in the GPS courses were enlightening. As graduate students, it can be very easy to be caught up in a bubble of repeated ideas and echo chambers, so I appreciate the opportunities the GPS courses have given me.

                In conclusion, this course has been fulfilling and enlightening in unexpected ways. It prompted a deep introspection, allowing me to explore and articulate aspects of myself like never before. These are things like my strengths, values, and personal mission. The incorporation of SMART goals, Individual Development Plans (IDPs), and learning artifacts were a great way in demonstrating tangible personal and professional growth. This experience has not only been a journey of acquiring new skills but also a profound exploration of self-improvement and self-awareness.
