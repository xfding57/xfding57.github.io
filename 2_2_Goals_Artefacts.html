                            <b>Specific:</b> During this term, I want to improve my ability to present one of my research projects. I have some data collected earlier in May and August and have a manuscript draft completed. There are several conferences and meetings this semester where I can practice and present my research.
                            <br><b>Measurable:</b> My progress will be tracked by counting the number of attendees I engage with and introduce my research to at each conference.
                            <br><b>Achievable:</b> I will showcase my research project via poster presentations at three conferences: the Biofabrication conference in September, Canadian Light Source Annual User Meeting in October, and the INSPIRE Workshop in December. These conferences are designed to foster graduate studentsâ€™ communication abilities. After each conference, I will reflect on feedback and refine my presentations.
                            <br><b>Relevant:</b> I remember at my first conference; I was so terribly afraid of criticism that I watched from afar as others walked by and glanced at my poster. I now know that engagement and feedback is critical for improving my work.
                            <br><b>Time-bound:</b> I aim to present at these conference presentations over the next 3 months to improve my scientific communication.

                            <b>1. How will you develop the knowledge you need to meet your goals?</b> I can attend webinars/workshops and read on how to communicate science. I can look into communicating at different levels i.e., teaching in a classroom setting or at academic conferences. There are often departmental conferences aimed at developing graduate student communication skills that are open to everyone. Some may be outside of my research area, but communication skills are transferable.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> I can practice these skills by conducting mock poster presentations to colleagues or friends before the actual conferences. Since I am part of a multidisciplinary group, there are many colleagues whose area of expertise differs from mine and those from completely different departments. I can practice explaining my research on different levels of base knowledge.
                            <br><b>3. How will you ask for feedback about your progress, and from whom?</b> After each mock presentation, I can ask for feedback on clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. After each conference presentation, I can ask attendees for their thoughts on your presentation style and content.
                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can record feedback received after each presentation and maintain a journal of lessons learned and areas of improvement after each conference.

                            <b>1. How will you develop the knowledge you need to meet your goals?</b> I can take workshops on how to effectively conduct literature review. I can study the literature thoroughly to understand the image processing technique. I can look through the body of work cited and the works that have since cited my desired literature. I can enroll in online courses or workshops that teach the technique or similar methodologies. I can also use library resources to help me more effectively look for literature.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> To practice, I can use sample datasets to apply the technique and test its efficacy. A test dataset which I can keep as a control group and gradually over time, I can integrate the technique into my main project workflow.
                            <br><b>3. How will you ask for feedback about your progress, and from whom?</b> I can share my results with colleagues, my supervisor, and advisors who have greater expertise.

                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can document the step-by-step process of integrating the technique.
