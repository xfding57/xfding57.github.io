                            <b>Specific:</b> During this term, I'll showcase my current research project via poster presentations at three pivotal conferences: the Biofabrication conference in September, Canadian Light Source Annual User Meeting in October, and the INSPIRE Workshop in December.
                            <br><b>Measurable:</b> My progress will be tracked by counting the number of attendees I engage with and introduce my research to at each conference.
                            <br><b>Achievable:</b> These conferences are designed to foster graduate studentsâ€™ communication abilities. After each conference, I will reflect on feedback and refine my presentations.
                            <br><b>Relevant:</b> I remember at my first conference; I was so terribly afraid of criticism that I watched from afar as others walked by and glanced at my poster. I now know that engagement and feedback is critical for improving my work.
                            <br><b>Time-bound:</b> I aim to present at these three conferences over the next 3 months.

                            <b>1. How will you develop the knowledge you need to meet your goals?</b> To develop the knowledge I need, I can attend webinars/workshops on effective scientific communication. There are often departmental conferences aimed at developing graduate student communication skills that are open to everyone. Although these might be outside of my area, communication skills are transferable. I can also read books and articles that provide insights into presenting research effectively.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> I can practice these skills by conducting mock poster presentations to colleagues or friends before the actual conferences. Since I am part of a multidisciplinary group, there are many colleagues whose area of expertise differs from mine and those from completely different departments. I can practice explaining my research on different levels of base knowledge.
                            <br><b>3. How will you ask for feedback about your progress, and from whom?</b> After each mock presentation, I can ask for feedback on clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. After each conference presentation, I can ask attendees for their thoughts on your presentation style and content.
                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can record feedback received after each presentation and maintain a journal of lessons learned and areas of improvement after each conference.

                            <b>Specific:</b> I have found an interesting image processing technique in literature that is relevant to my project. I aim to incorporate this into my current project workflow.
                            <br><b>Measurable:</b> Because this is an image processing technique as a computer program, my progress can be tracked by my code commits over time.
                            <br><b>Achievable:</b> I will book a high performing computer every Thursday to dedicate time to understand, implement, and test this technique.
                            <br><b>Relevant:</b> Very often in my field, there are many small image processing programs created and forgotten about. The program that I am interested in reproducing was published in 2017 and has not seen an update since. It has since become incompatible with current standards.
                            <br><b>Time-bound:</b> I aim to have a working script in the next 3 months.

                            <b>1. How will you develop the knowledge you need to meet your goals?</b> I can study the literature thoroughly to understand the image processing technique. I can look through the body of work cited and the works that have since cited my desired literature. I can enroll in online courses or workshops that teach the technique or similar methodologies. I can also use library resources to help me more effectively look for literature.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> To practice, I can use sample datasets to apply the technique and test its efficacy. A test dataset which I can keep as a control group and gradually over time, I can integrate the technique into my main project workflow.
                            <br><b>3. How will you ask for feedback about your progress, and from whom?</b> I can share my results with colleagues, my supervisor, and advisors who have greater expertise. I can also reach out to authors of the original literature for their insights, recommendations, and help on technical aspects.
                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can document the step-by-step process of integrating the technique. For scripts and computer programs, I can manage the progress through a version control platform like GitHub. This will save code versions, outputs, and any other technical documentation.

                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> Evidence will be in logs of the events attended, people met, and the nature of discussions. In-person events could be recorded with the other partyâ€™s consent. Online events can be documented in the conversation history and the growth in LinkedIn connections or other networking platforms.
