                            <b>Specific:</b> During this term, I want to improve my ability to present one of my research projects. I have some data collected earlier in May and August and have a manuscript draft completed. There are several conferences and meetings this semester where I can practice and present my research.
                            <br><b>Measurable:</b> My progress will be tracked by counting the number of attendees I engage with and introduce my research to at each conference.
                            <br><b>Achievable:</b> I will showcase my research project via poster presentations at three conferences: the Biofabrication conference in September, Canadian Light Source Annual User Meeting in October, and the INSPIRE Workshop in December. These conferences are designed to foster graduate studentsâ€™ communication abilities. After each conference, I will reflect on feedback and refine my presentations.
                            <br><b>Relevant:</b> I remember at my first conference; I was so terribly afraid of criticism that I watched from afar as others walked by and glanced at my poster. I now know that engagement and feedback is critical for improving my work.
                            <br><b>Time-bound:</b> I aim to present at these conference presentations over the next 3 months to improve my scientific communication.
