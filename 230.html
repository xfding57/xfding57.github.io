                            <b>Specific:</b> During this term, I want to improve my ability to present one of my research projects. I have some data collected earlier in May and August and have a manuscript draft completed. There are several conferences and meetings this semester where I can practice and present my research.
                            <br><b>Measurable:</b> My progress will be tracked by counting the number of attendees I engage with and introduce my research to at each conference.
                            <br><b>Achievable:</b> I will showcase my research project via poster presentations at three conferences: the Biofabrication conference in September, Canadian Light Source Annual User Meeting in October, and the INSPIRE Workshop in December. These conferences are designed to foster graduate studentsâ€™ communication abilities. After each conference, I will reflect on feedback and refine my presentations.
                            <br><b>Relevant:</b> I remember at my first conference; I was so terribly afraid of criticism that I watched from afar as others walked by and glanced at my poster. I now know that engagement and feedback is critical for improving my work.
                            <br><b>Time-bound:</b> I aim to present at these conference presentations over the next 3 months to improve my scientific communication.

                            <b>1. How will you develop the knowledge you need to meet your goals?</b> I can attend webinars/workshops and read on how to communicate science. I can look into communicating at different levels i.e., teaching in a classroom setting or at academic conferences. There are often departmental conferences aimed at developing graduate student communication skills that are open to everyone. Some may be outside of my research area, but communication skills are transferable.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> I can practice these skills by conducting mock poster presentations to colleagues or friends before the actual conferences. Since I am part of a multidisciplinary group, there are many colleagues whose area of expertise differs from mine and those from completely different departments. I can practice explaining my research on different levels of base knowledge.
                            <br><b>3. How will you ask for feedback about your progress, and from whom?</b> After each mock presentation, I can ask for feedback on clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. After each conference presentation, I can ask attendees for their thoughts on your presentation style and content.
                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can record feedback received after each presentation and maintain a journal of lessons learned and areas of improvement after each conference.

I can study the literature thoroughly to understand the image processing technique. I can look through the body of work cited and the works that have since cited my desired literature. I can enroll in online courses or workshops that teach the technique or similar methodologies. I can also use library resources to help me more effectively look for literature.
                            <br><b>2. How will you practice the skills you need to meet your goals?</b> To practice, I can use sample datasets to apply the technique and test its efficacy.

                            <br><b>3.

                            <br><b>4. What evidence do you expect to collect of your learning and skill?</b> I can document the step-by-step process of integrating the technique. For scripts and computer programs, I can manage the progress through a version control platform like GitHub. This will save code versions, outputs, and any other technical documentation.

                            <br><b>Description Experience: </b>This book was recommended to me by an advisor in 2018 when I mentioned that I enjoyed teaching. I never got around to reading it until the GPS course. I used this opportunity to explore how to better communicate science. I found this book to be an excellent window for those interested in academic careers that lean on the side of teaching. It covers unique stories of current professionals and gives someone like me, a novice, a look into academic teaching. This is helpful towards my first learning goal.

This was recommended to me by my learning coach who has been in the workforce for over a decade now and it helped him in his professional life. Although I am still in school, there are a variety of situations where this book provides excellent advice. In grad school, the hierarchy between PIs and students is not unlike the hierarchy of a workplace and managing main projects, side projects, learning to let things go, and creating a prioirty chart are useful to me and are some of the things that I learned from this book. This is helpful towards my third learning goal.

                            <b>Linkedin Learning: Artificial Intelligence Foundations</b>
                            <br>Skills Domains: Domain Knowledge
                            <br>Description Experience: This course is a introduction to different kinds of artificial intelligence and how they are used. I am a novice in this area but my supervisor wants to incorporate some sort of AI and machine learning into our projects. This course was a great way to get started and helpful in determining the key works for my literature review search as part of my second learning goal.

                            <br>Description Experience: The mentorship circle is a gathering of graduate fellows in the INSPIRE fellowship aimed at fostering discussion. The members are from different areas of research it's a rewarding experience to hear how grad students cope with research, project management, and personal lives. The idea is for fellows to mentor each other which is excellent for improving communication and interpersonal skills. The mentorship circles help towards first learning goal.

                            <br>Description Experience: I learned this method of task management from someone at my church that I consider a mentor. The idea is that one's supervisor would only see results and is unlikely to understand how difficult a process is. The spreadsheet shows ongoing tasks, how much is done, and what is being stalled. Bringing this to table helps improve communication between supervisor and student. This contributes towards my third learning goal.

                            <br>Description Experience: I participated at the Canadian Light Source Annual User Meeting with a poster presentation. I was able to effectively communicate my recent research. Fortunately, my presentation reached enough senior researchers that I won first prize at the meeting. This is evidence that I have progressed in my first learning goal.

                I chose Thain-Peng Ter as my learning coach. He is a Senior Product Development Manager at Workiva with over 15 years of professional experience. Beyond his professional career, he also leads the bible study group that I take part in. I deeply respect Thian-Peng's transition from academia to industry. He has shared this experience with me and helped illustrate how my experience in academia can translate to the workplace. Furthermore, his ability to balance work, personal life, and spiritual commitments is something I aspire to work towards. In recent months, our discussions have centered on how to align my goals with my supervisors, building relationships, managing up, balancing life, building good hapits, and valuing our church community. I often look forward to and enjoy our chats with plenty of things to learn from.
